Description: This project consisted of a server and client communication that completed a few tasks.
	     smalld was the server while smallSet, smallGet, and smallDigest were client programs.
	     In each of these functions we used both Rio_readn() and Rio_writen.  In the smallDigest
	     function we also used popen() and pclose() to store the incovation of the echo function
	     into a file. We also used vectors to store the variables and values that were printed 
	     in smallGet. Wherever we used Rio_readn() and Rio_writen(), we also used network byte
	     order that formats the sent and received information in a standard way.

Limitations: There are no limitations for our program to our knowledge.
